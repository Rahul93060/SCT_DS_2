🚢 Task 02: Titanic Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I worked on Task 02, which involved performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
🔍 What I did:
Loaded and cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns like Cabin)
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover survival trends
Visualized key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Analyzed survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and age
Created a correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships
📊 Skills Applied:
 Pandas | Seaborn | Matplotlib | EDA | Data Cleaning | Data Visualization | Python
This task helped me enhance my ability to extract insights from real-world datasets and improve storytelling through visualizations.
